# Uncover-your-mask
GANs for recovering the human face

Our project is to fulfill a target that Given human face with masks, then we simply let the model train to learn some features from the original face except from the mask area. Finally we can teach the machine to try their best to uncover the mask and estimate what it will look like for the original face.
